# Struct

A **struct** is a composite type that groups together variables (called fields) under a single name. You can also assign a method against a struct.

## A Method

A **method** is a function that is associated with a specific typeâ€”either a struct or a named type. The key components of a method are:

* reciever typea
* method name
* method argument and return types

## Working Examples

* [Equality](./struct_equality_test.go)
* [Embedded](./struct_embedded_test.go)
* [Member methods](./struct_methods_test.go)
