# Logging

There are two logging packages for unstructured and a structured logger.

## Structured logger

A structured logger is package as `slog`.

Here are working examples demonstrating different ways of using slog.

* [Example 1 - Instantiating a logger](./slog/ex1/main.go)
* [Example 2 - Setting default logger](./slog/ex2/main.go)

Here are some useful references to the inner workings of slog.
