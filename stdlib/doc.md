# Exploring the Go Standard Library

This section of my journal is dedicated to a deep dive into the Go standard library. I believe that a thorough understanding of the standard library is fundamental to becoming a proficient Go programmer.

My research will cover a range of packages, and I will be documenting my findings and experiments here. The packages I am currently focusing on include:

* [Context](./context/doc.md)
* [Date & Time](./date/doc.md)
* [Encoding](./encoding/doc.md)
* [Error Handling](./error/doc.md)
* [I/O](./io/doc.md)
* [Logging](./logging/doc.md)
* [Networking](./networking/doc.md)
* [Operating System](./os/doc.md)
* [Reflection](./reflection/doc.md)
* [Runtime](./runtime/doc.md)

I will be adding more packages to this list as my research progresses. My goal is to create a comprehensive reference that I can use in the future and that may also be of benefit to others who are on a similar learning path.
