The standard libraries includes two functions to serializes an object 

## JSON serializer

Here is a set of working examples demonstrating the use standard library to serialize object to json.

* [Example 1 - Serialising without JSON tags](./ecodejson/ex1_test.go)
* [Example 2 - Serialising with tags](./ecodejson/ex2_test.go)
* [Example 3 - Custom serialisation](./ecodejson/ex3_test.go)
* [Example 4 - Unmarshaling to interface](./ecodejson/ex4_test.go)
* [Example 5 - Unmarshaling field with different types](./ecodejson/ex5_test.go)

## XML serializer

## Non-standard libraries
