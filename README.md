# Learn Go: My Notes on a Language as It Evolves

Welcome to my personal journal. This is a living document where I, with the help of [contributors](./CONTRIBUTORS), document my journey as I follow the evolution of the Go programming language.

Inside, you'll find my notes and working examples based on my observations of Go's evolution. I've organised these findings on a thematic basis.

Please think of these as my shared field notes, not as definitive statements on the language itself.
