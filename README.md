# Learn Go: Our Notes on a Language as It Evolves

Welcome to our collective journal. This is a living journal where we, [contributors](./CONTRIBUTORS) to this project, document our journey as we follow the evolution of the Go programming language.

Inside, you'll find notes and working examples based on our observations of Go's evolution. We've organised these findings on a thematic basis.

Please think of these as our shared field notes, not as definitive statements on the language itself.
